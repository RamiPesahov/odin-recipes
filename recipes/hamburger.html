    <h3>Description:</h3>

    <p>A hamburger (or burger for short) is a food, typically considered a sandwich, consisting of one or more cooked
         patties—usually ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. The patty may be pan fried, grilled,
          smoked or flame broiled. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chilis; condiments such as ketchup,
           mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a "special sauce", often a variation of Thousand Island dressing;
         and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger. </p>

    <p>The term burger can also be applied to the meat patty on its own, especially in the United Kingdom, where the
         term patty is rarely used, or the term can even refer simply to ground beef. Since the term hamburger usually implies beef,
          for clarity burger may be prefixed with the type of meat or meat substitute used
        , as in beef burger, turkey burger, bison burger, portobello burger, or veggie burger.  </p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> ¼ pound lean ground beef </li>
        <li> ⅛ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce </li>
        <li> ¼ teaspoon dried parsley </li>
        <li> salt and pepper to taste  </li>
        <li> ¼ cup crumbled feta cheese </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate. </li>
        <li> Knead together the ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, parsley, salt, 
            and pepper in a bowl. Form the mixture into 8 equal-sized balls; flatten to make thin patties. 
            Place about 1/4 cup of feta cheese onto each of four of the patties. Top each of the patties with cheese with one of the 
            patties without; press the edges together to seal the cheese into the center. </li>
        <li> Cook on the preheated grill until the burgers are cooked to your desired degree of doneness, 7 to 8 minutes per side for well done. 
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). </li>
    </ol>
