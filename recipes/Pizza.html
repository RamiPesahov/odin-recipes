    <h3>Description:</h3>

    <p>Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian origin
         consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients
          (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.
           A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo. </p>

    <p> In Italy, pizza served in formal settings, such as at a restaurant, is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.
         In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.</p>
